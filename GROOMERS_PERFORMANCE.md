Mobile Groomers, What are you doing?
-Performance wise. If you could answer these questions in the comments that would be great:

-How many dogs do you groom in your day?

-how long are your shifts?

-do you get a break (lunch break and bathroom breaks)?

-how long do you spend per day driving between appointments?

-How long would it take you to groom a mini golden doodle that wants an Ecc vs a 7a/o tbh?

-HOW ARE YOU NOT LOSING YOUR MIND

i work an 10 hr shift and apparently the company wants their groomers to be doing 6-10 full haircuts in that time but i just don’t see how it’s possible when i have less than 7 hours of grooming time because I’m driving 30 minutes between each appointment.

I just want to see if what they’re asking for is possible, i’m just switching from an in person salon and honestly i struggle to do even 5 dogs. I used to do 8-10 but doing every dog as an express and then also the drive time???? feels impossible

I do 4-6 on average. If it’s all haircuts, 4. If there’s some baths sprinkled in or all baths, 6. Most I’ve ever done was 7 but it was all baths.

I typically work from 8am—5pm, but I’m a bit faster than most people. Most of my coworkers get off between 6-7pm. But we only work 4 days a week.

We can take breaks but it’s not scheduled. It’s just whenever you have time. I typically take a 15 minute lunch in the middle of the day. I also typically stop once or twice a day to use the restroom at a store or at HQ if im close.

Most of my appointments are within half an hour from each other if not even closer. Only on a bad traffic day do I spend longer in the van driving between my clients.

I’m not sure if I know what lingo you’re using (ecc?) but most doodles take me between 2-3 hours, depending on size and fur density. My biggest doodle can take up to 4 hours, which is the longest I’ve spent on one dog in one appointment.

It’s the only grooming job I’ve had haha, but I enjoy it. I do miss chatting with coworkers and it’s very solitary but I get a lot of reading done (audiobooks) and it’s nice.

What they’re asking seems unfeasible. I mean, I’m fairly fast compared to my coworkers and I think the most haircuts I could do in a single day is 6 and that’s PUSHING it. But my boss is also very chill and is a groomer himself, so he knows how it is. If it were me, I’d be finding a different job— even another mobile place— because it sounds like your boss is out of their mind with their expectations and is putting profits over people.

6 to 8 dogs. I have done 9 but that’s only possible with small dogs.

I’m usually there all day unless it’s just baths.

no; but that’s by choice

we have a 5 mile rule we try to stick by

2 hrs for the Ecc ; shave downs are usually an hour

I am losing my mind

I HAVE to work this much. My boss is pretty chill and would never willingly do this to a groomer. I just have bills and debts to pay off.

1.) I have done 9 dogs before (4 of them were bath chihuahuas at 1 house) but for the most part I cap 5-6 and average at 4-5

2.) 9-(2-4) depends on what I schedule that day. If I have a harder dog or a big family I will cut my day short. Basically I do what I want for my schedule. If I have someone who NEEDS 8am I might do it if I really like them but I never take an appointment later than 4. I did when I started but now that I am comfortable I close my day out earlier.

3.) If I want. I usually just eat between 2 appointments where I have time. Sometimes this will be a quick 10 minute gas station stop and sometimes it’s a real 30 minute break.

4.) I usually schedule 20-30 minutes of drive time by often they are shorter

5.) most small dogs take 1hr (depends on behavior and coat of course) rarely does any dog take longer than 1.5hrs

6.) I choose my schedule and my clients, how could I go crazy? - Start your own so you can have a good work life balance that you choose

PS even working at basically 1/2 capacity I gross ~$80k per year. I could do better but Im a textbook lazy taurus 😅😅

I’ve worked for 2 mobile companies. One was the most popular private mobile in the city and the other was a poorly run franchise.

I’d groom 4-6 dogs a day.

I’d start at 8am and went home around 6pm.

No breaks. I brought a camping toilet for a reason.

Anywhere from 5 minutes to 45 minutes.

Assuming the dog is under 30 lbs and has fabulous coat/temperament and no mats, then a shave down would take 1-2 hrs. E c would take 2-3 hrs but I’m big on fluff drying and letting products sit.

I actually loved mobile. Just hated the people I worked for and the lack of benefits. My biggest problem was the routing. Idk why no one can figure it out, but a friend of mine went to work for a very prestigious mobile groomer a few hours from me and they sucked at routing as well.

Let me guess. You’re working for a franchise?

When I was mobile, my time was better than in a salon setting because there's a lot less walking around.

That being said, I was expected to take 5 appts a day with each scheduled for 2 hours. So while it could amount to a 10 hour day, I usually started at 8am and was done around 4-5pm, then had to clean the van for the night.

We also didn't take any dogs over 50 lbs but tried to keep it around 40 lbs tops.

An Ec doodle might take more or less time than a 7 shave depending on frequency/upkeep. I'm pretty fluent with my scissor work (I used to have several all over hand scissor doodle clients that came every 2 weeks - not mobile), so that part doesn't take me long. But if I've gotta do a pre-shave on that 7, it might take me longer just based on safety and behavior.

All of that to say: I would consider myself an average groomer as far as time goes (definitely not fast, but also not slow) and there's no way I would do 6+ dogs in a 10 hr day mobile UNLESS they are all regulars and within 15 minutes of each other.

I groom 3-4 dogs a day. 4-5 hour days. I swing home In between stops. I don’t cover a huge area only a 5-10 mile radius.

Longest length I leave on a doodle is a o comb. Won’t do E comb. I won’t take dogs in that take longer than 2 hours to do.

5-6. I start at 10 and I’m done by 6. I eat whenever and have bathroom breaks, honestly after my hysterectomy I have to go right then and there sooooo. My longest drive is 45 mins due to traffic, on average 15-20 mins. Mini doodle will take 1 hour and 15 mins to 1.5 hours.

How am I not losing my mind? Well I make really really good money. I make over 1k in tips every two weeks and 1500-2000 in commission.

To piggy back on OP, Doing 4-6 dogs a day are you making as much as in a salon? What is your yearly average pay? If you don’t mind me asking.

i’m making less now, in my old salon i was doing about $2600 in sales per week and made 50% and now i’m making around the same sales but the commission is only 35%. i thought because the tickets were higher i would be making the same if not more but i didn’t realize i would be so limited with the amount of dogs i can do

I work 8am-7pm and usually do 5-7 dogs a day, depending on the dogs. If they’re all small dogs under 20 lbs then I may have 5-6 haircuts, but most days I have at least 1-3 baths.

I dont get a scheduled break but I bring my lunch and just eat it whenever I have time, and keep some random snacks with me as well. If I need to use the bathroom for a #2 then I just stop on the way to a stop or ask a client if I can use their bathroom if they’re cool. Even if I’m running behind, 99% of clients understand that if you gotta go you gotta go. I’m a dude so if I have to pee I just use some empty water bottles…

An average mini doodle getting a 7k cut usually is around 90 minutes, 2 hours give or take if it’s a longer cut.

6-10 haircuts in 10 hours mobile is unreasonable though, especially factoring drive time. Sounds like they want you to inevitably work more like 12 hours or more. The unfortunate thing I’ve noticed about mobile businesses is that they often are not run by actual people with grooming experience, so they have a little understanding of how long things take.

Do 7 most days. Little slow so like 5 or 6 now. Can do 8 even. But when I do 7 dogs, I usually pick up the mobile van for the company. I work for at 7 o’clock, my first appointment starts at eight. And then I’m usually done and dropped off no later than four. I’ll take lunch after my 3rd dog

I do 3-4, I'm a slower dog groomer! I usually work 10-11 hours in a shift 4 times a week! I sometimes get a lunch although most of the time it's maybe 20 mins or so max parked at a Target or some other chain supermarket.

I take about 2 nd a half hours for a mini goldendoodle! And maybe 2-2.5 hours are spent driving throughout my shifts. I drive abt 30 mins between each appointment. I honestly hate end of the day cleaning the most.

A E CC would take me the full 2.5 hours. A 7 a/o would take me approximately 1.75 hrs, I pre-shave so it goes by faster. Also for a 7 strip I don't really get picky with them. Clearly the owners don't care about aesthetics if they're going bald LMAO.

As far as keeping sane, I love driving! I enjoy the solitude and driving. I'll listen to a podcast while driving or bump my fav songs. Its easy to keep my brain occupied with YouTube haha.
