# GroomRoute Features Overview

**GroomRoute** is a comprehensive business management platform built specifically for mobile dog groomers. Every feature is designed to solve real problems that mobile groomers face daily.

## Who We Built This For

Mobile dog groomers are independent professionals who drive to customers' homes to groom pets. They face unique challenges:

- **Routing headaches** — Driving 30+ minutes between appointments kills productivity
- **Physical demands** — Grooming large dogs is exhausting; overloading leads to burnout
- **Schedule chaos** — Cancellations, no-shows, and last-minute changes disrupt the day
- **Admin overload** — Tracking customers, pets, payments, and schedules takes time away from grooming

GroomRoute tackles all of these.

## Built By Groomers, For Groomers

Every feature in GroomRoute comes from real conversations with mobile dog groomers about their daily challenges. We didn't build a generic scheduling tool and slap a dog icon on it. We built something that understands:

- That a 90-pound Goldendoodle is a different kind of appointment than a 10-pound Yorkie
- That driving across town between appointments isn't just inconvenient — it's profit-destroying
- That saying "yes" to every appointment leads to burnout
- That knowing a customer has cancelled three times changes how you handle them
- That the best route isn't always the shortest distance — it's the one that gets you home on time

**GroomRoute is the co-pilot every mobile groomer deserves.**
