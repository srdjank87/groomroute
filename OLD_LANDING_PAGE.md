Turn chaotic grooming days into calm, optimized routes — without working longer hours.

GroomRoute helps mobile dog groomers cut drive time, stop running late, and fit more dogs into each day — automatically.

This is the part of mobile grooming no one warns you about

I love grooming dogs.
I don’t love zig-zagging across town, apologizing for being late, or realizing I lost an entire hour to driving.

If you’re a mobile groomer, you know the real problems aren’t grooming — they’re everything between appointments:

You book a “full day”… but it’s spread all over town

One late stop throws off the rest of the schedule

Cancellations leave dead gaps you can’t easily fill

You spend more time planning routes than actually grooming

Customers keep asking, “What time will you be here?”

Most scheduling tools don’t fix this — because they weren’t built for mobile grooming.

GroomRoute was.

What GroomRoute actually does (in plain English)

GroomRoute looks at where your customers live, how long each groom takes, and when you want to start your day — then builds the most efficient route automatically.

You click one button.
Your day makes sense.

Optimize your entire day in one click
“Optimize My Day” Routing

Automatically orders your appointments to minimize driving

Calculates real drive times between each stop

Builds a clear, logical route for your day

Updates instantly when something changes

No spreadsheets.
No Google Maps juggling.
No mental gymnastics at 7am.

Know exactly when you’ll arrive — and leave
Smart ETAs & Timing

For every stop, GroomRoute calculates:

Arrival time

Service time

Departure time

Drive time to the next client

So you can:

Stop guessing

Stop running late

Stop under- or over-booking your day

Your schedule becomes predictable again.

Built for real mobile grooming days

This isn’t “tech for tech’s sake.”
It’s built around how mobile groomers actually work.

Customer & Pet Profiles

Store addresses once (accurately geocoded)

Notes, preferences, and pet details tied to each visit

Appointment Scheduling

Set service duration per appointment

Optional time windows (morning only, after 10am, etc.)

Assign appointments to specific groomers or vans

Route Rebuilds

Cancellation? Reschedule?

One click and your route recalculates — cleanly.

Spend less time driving. Make more money per day.

When your route is optimized:

You fit more dogs into the same hours

You burn less fuel

You finish your day earlier (or earn more without extending it)

Even saving 30–60 minutes a day adds up fast.

Professional communication — without extra work (optional)

Once your day is optimized, GroomRoute helps you look more professional to your clients:

Automated appointment reminders

“On my way” ETA messages

Fewer “Where are you?” texts

Happier, more relaxed customers

All based on your actual route — not guesses.

Built-in growth (only if you want it)

Most groomers don’t need “marketing tools.”
They need a full schedule without chaos.

That’s why GroomRoute keeps growth optional and contextual:

Automated rebooking reminders

Review request messages after completed grooms

Insights into which days or areas are under-booked

And if you ever want help filling slow days or growing locally — it’s there.
If not, GroomRoute still works perfectly on its own.

Why GroomRoute is different

Most tools:

Schedule appointments

Leave routing to you

GroomRoute:

Understands geography

Understands grooming durations

Understands mobile realities

It doesn’t just organize your calendar.
It organizes your day.

Our promise to you

If GroomRoute doesn’t noticeably reduce your drive time and scheduling stress within your first few weeks…

You shouldn’t pay for it.

No long onboarding.
No complex setup.
No fluff.

Ready to run calmer, more profitable days?
