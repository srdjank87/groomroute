## The Real Problem Section

### This is the part of mobile grooming no one warns you about

I love grooming dogs.

I don't love zig-zagging across town, apologizing for being late, or realizing I lost an entire hour to driving.

If you're a mobile groomer, you know the real problems aren't grooming — they're everything *between* appointments:

**You book a "full day"… but it's spread all over town**
One client's in the north suburbs. The next is downtown. The third is back where you started.

**One late stop throws off the rest of the schedule**
Then you're playing phone tag all afternoon: "I'm running 20 minutes late… make that 30…"

**Cancellations leave dead gaps you can't easily fill**
Mrs. Johnson cancels at 10am for her 2pm slot. You just lost $85 and have a 2-hour hole in your day.

**You spend more time planning routes than actually grooming**
Staring at Google Maps at 6:30am, mentally calculating drive times, hoping you got the order right.

**Customers keep asking, "What time will you be here?"**
Because you said "between 2 and 3" but you're not sure yourself.

**And worst of all? Your customers think you're disorganized.**
Even though you're an incredible groomer. Even though you care deeply. They see the late arrivals, the missed reminder texts, the "I forgot your gate code" calls… and they judge you for it.

Most scheduling tools don't fix this — because they weren't built for mobile grooming.

GroomRoute was.

## What GroomRoute Actually Does

### What GroomRoute actually does (in plain English)

GroomRoute looks at where your customers live, how long each groom takes, and when you want to start your day — then builds the most efficient route automatically.

You click one button.
Your day makes sense.

And your customers get professional, timely communication — like you have an assistant (you don't, you just have GroomRoute).

---

## Core Features Section

### Optimize your entire day in one click

**"Optimize My Day" Routing**

- Automatically orders your appointments to minimize driving
- Calculates real drive times between each stop
- Builds a clear, logical route for your day
- Updates instantly when something changes

No spreadsheets.
No Google Maps juggling.
No mental gymnastics at 7am.

**The result:**
Most groomers save 45–90 minutes per day. That's 6–12 hours per week. You can either fit in more dogs or go home earlier.

---

### Know exactly when you'll arrive — and leave

**Smart ETAs & Timing**

For every stop, GroomRoute calculates:

- Arrival time
- Service time
- Departure time
- Drive time to the next client

So you can:

- Stop guessing
- Stop running late
- Stop under- or over-booking your day

Your schedule becomes predictable again.

---

### Professional communication — without extra work

**Automated Messages That Make You Look Good**

Once your day is optimized, GroomRoute helps you look more professional to your clients:

**Automated appointment reminders**
"Hi Sarah! This is a reminder that Fluffy's grooming appointment is tomorrow at 2pm. Reply YES to confirm."

**"On my way" messages**
One tap sends: "I'm on my way! ETA: 15 minutes."

**Running late? Update everyone at once**
Hit "Running Late" → select 15/30/45 min delay → everyone gets updated automatically.

**After the appointment: request reviews**
"Thanks for trusting us with Fluffy! How did we do? [Review Link]"

All based on your actual route — not guesses.

**Here's what this does for your business:**

Your customers get consistent, timely updates. They think you're organized. They think you have systems. They think you're professional.

*Because you are. Now it shows.*

---

### Turn cancellations into bookings

**Gap-Fill System**

Mrs. Johnson cancels her 2pm appointment?

GroomRoute immediately:

- Identifies the gap (2pm–4pm)
- Finds customers on your waitlist nearby
- Sends them: "Last-minute opening today 2–4pm in your area! Reply YES to book."
- Tracks who responds

Most groomers fill 20–30% of their cancellation gaps this way.

That's $200–400/month in recovered revenue. From appointments that would've just been lost.

---

### Never show up unprepared again

**Address Validation & Safety Warnings**

When you add a customer:

- We geocode the address and show you a map pin
- You confirm: "Yes, that's the right location"
- Add notes: "Gate code 1234, park in driveway, use back door"

When you view your route:

- **🚨 Big red warnings** for aggressive dogs, muzzle requirements, special equipment
- Can't start the appointment without seeing the warnings
- Access notes displayed clearly

**Zero wrong addresses.**
**Zero forgotten muzzles.**
**Zero showing up unprepared.**

You look confident and professional every single time.

---

### Build your reputation while you work

**Automated Review Requests**

After every completed appointment, GroomRoute sends a simple message:

*"Thanks for trusting us with Fluffy! How did we do? We'd love your feedback: [Review Link]"*

**The math:**

- 20 appointments/week × 4 weeks = 80 appointments/month
- Even a 15% review rate = 12 new reviews/month
- In 6 months, you go from 8 reviews to 80+ reviews

**What this means:**

- You show up higher in Google search
- New customers pick you over competitors (social proof works)
- You can charge 10–15% more (premium reputation = premium pricing)

All automatic. You just groom. The reviews come in.

---

### See where your business is actually growing

**Growth Insights Dashboard**

After every route, you see:

- Total revenue for the day
- Drive time vs. service time
- Gas cost estimate
- Your effective hourly rate

**Plus:**

- New vs. repeat customers this month
- Which neighborhoods book most often
- Which days have capacity for more clients
- Where your business is thriving (and where it's not)

This is important. Because once you know where you're strong, you can make smarter decisions.

*(And if you want help getting more clients in those high-performing areas, we can help with that. More on that below.)*

## Built for Real Mobile Grooming

### Built for real mobile grooming days

This isn't "tech for tech's sake."
It's built around how mobile groomers actually work.

**Customer & Pet Profiles**

- Store addresses once (accurately geocoded)
- Notes, preferences, and pet details tied to each visit
- Behavior flags: Anxious, Aggressive, Muzzle Required, Two-Person Needed
- Equipment tags: Heavy Duty Dryer, Table Extender, etc.

**Appointment Scheduling**

- Set service duration per appointment
- Optional time windows (morning only, after 10am, etc.)
- Assign appointments to specific groomers or vans
- Status tracking: Booked → Confirmed → Completed

**Route Rebuilds**

- Cancellation? Reschedule? New appointment added?
- One click and your route recalculates — cleanly
- Shows you before/after comparison: "Save 38 minutes with this route"

---

## Time & Money Impact

### Spend less time driving. Make more money per day.

When your route is optimized:

- **You fit more dogs into the same hours** (or finish earlier)
- **You burn less fuel** (less zig-zagging)
- **You arrive on time** (customers are happy, you're not stressed)
- **You recover lost revenue** (gap-fill system works)
- **You build your reputation** (automated reviews add up fast)

Even saving 30–60 minutes a day adds up fast.

**60 min/day × 5 days = 5 hours/week**
**5 hours/week × 4 weeks = 20 hours/month**

That's half a work week. Every month.

You can either:
- Add 4–6 more appointments/month ($340–510 revenue)
- Go home at 4pm instead of 6pm (quality of life)
- Both

---

## Professional Image Section

### Your grooming is 10/10. Does your business look like it?

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

You're an incredible groomer. You genuinely care about the dogs. You've got years of experience.

**But when customers are comparing you to another groomer who:**

- Has 94 Google reviews (you have 8)
- Sends automated appointment reminders (you text manually when you remember)
- Always shows up on time (you're running 20 min late again)

**They pick the other groomer.**

Not because they're better at grooming. Because they *look* more professional.

### GroomRoute closes that gap

**Professional Communication:**
Automated, branded messages. Looks like you have an office manager (you don't).

**Flawless Execution:**
Always on time. Never lost. Never unprepared.

**Growing Reputation:**
Steady stream of new reviews. Higher Google ranking. Social proof that converts.

**The compound effect:**

- **Month 1:** You save 8hrs/week, fill 3 cancellation gaps, get 12 new reviews
- **Month 3:** You have 36 new reviews, show up #1 in local search, book 5–8 extra jobs/month
- **Month 6:** You've added $4,000–6,000 in monthly revenue, you're charging 15% more, you finish work by 4pm

This isn't magic. It's just operations + reputation working together.

---

## Optional Growth Support

### Want more clients? (Only if you want them.)

Most groomers don't need "marketing tools."
They need a full schedule without chaos.

That's why GroomRoute keeps growth optional and contextual.

**Built-in features** (included in all plans):
- Automated rebooking reminders (6–8 weeks after service)
- Review request messages after completed grooms
- Insights into which days or areas are under-booked

**But here's where it gets interesting:**

GroomRoute already knows where your business is thriving.

We see:
- Which neighborhoods book most often
- Which customers refer the most
- Which service types are most profitable
- Where you have capacity to take more clients

Most groomers look at this data and think: *"Huh, that's cool."*

Smart groomers think: *"How do I get MORE customers in those high-value neighborhoods?"*

---

### Done-for-you marketing (if you're ready to grow faster)

We run a marketing agency that specializes in local service businesses.

- **Local Google Ads** (show up when people search "mobile dog groomer near me")
- **Review funnel optimization** (get more reviews faster, rank higher)
- **Rebooking automation** (turn one-time customers into recurring clients)
- **Neighborhood targeting** (dominate the areas where you're already strong)

**Step 1:** You use GroomRoute and love it (operational value comes first)

**Step 2:** You see growth opportunities in your data

**Step 3:** You book a free 30-min strategy call with Sandra (no pressure, just ideas)

**Step 4:** If it makes sense, we help you grow. If not, no worries — keep using GroomRoute and keep crushing it.

### Why we're different

We're not some generic marketing agency that's never groomed a dog.

**We built GroomRoute.** We understand your business. We know your customer data, your service areas, your capacity constraints.

That means:
- No wasted ad spend on customers you can't serve
- No generic marketing that doesn't fit mobile grooming
- No "throw spaghetti at the wall" strategies

**Just targeted growth in the areas where you have capacity and data proves demand.**

### Interested?

— *Sarah M., Austin TX (3 years experience)*

---

**"Filled a cancellation within 20 minutes"**

## FAQ Section (Expanded)

### Questions mobile groomers ask us

**"Do I need to be tech-savvy?"**
No. If you can schedule appointments and use Google Maps, you can use GroomRoute. Most groomers are fully set up in under 30 minutes.

**"Does this work for solo groomers?"**
Yes — and it scales cleanly if you add vans or staff later.

**"What if my schedule changes?"**
Click rebuild. Your route updates instantly. Shows you the new optimized order and updated ETAs.

**"Will my customers know I'm using GroomRoute?"**
The automated messages are branded with YOUR business name. They see: "Reminder from [Your Business Name]" — not "sent via GroomRoute."

**"What if my customers don't have smartphones?"**
No problem. Reminders work via regular SMS text messages or email. They don't need an app or any special tech.

**"How do the automated review requests work?"**
After you mark an appointment as "completed," GroomRoute sends: "Thanks for trusting us with Fluffy! How did we do? [Review Link]" — You control the timing and message template.

**"What maps provider do you use?"**
Google Maps (or Mapbox if you prefer). Same accurate drive times and routes you already trust.

**"Can I customize the reminder messages?"**
Yes! You control all message templates. Add your business name, your tone, your personality. GroomRoute sends them for you, but they're YOUR messages.

**"Tell me more about the marketing services. Is this a bait-and-switch?"**
No. GroomRoute works perfectly on its own — you never have to buy marketing services. But we're a marketing agency, and we built GroomRoute because we understand mobile service businesses. IF you want help growing (and IF your data shows you have capacity), we offer done-for-you marketing. It's optional, contextual, and only offered after you're already getting value from the product. No pressure. No forced upsells.

**"Can I try it before I commit?"**
100%. Start a 14-day free trial. No credit card required. Import your customers, schedule appointments, optimize a route, get some reviews. If you don't see value by day 3, it's not for you.

**"What happens to my data if I cancel?"**
You own your data. Export your customer list, appointment history, reviews, and notes anytime (even after canceling). We don't hold your data hostage.
