## 📝 Copy Highlights

### Best Lines (Conversion Gold)

**Problem Empathy:**
> "I love grooming dogs. I don't love zig-zagging across town, apologizing for being late, or realizing I lost an entire hour to driving."

**Simple Value Prop:**
> "You click one button. Your day makes sense."

**Professional Image:**
> "Your customers get consistent, timely updates. They think you're organized. They think you have systems. Because you are. Now it shows."

**Gap-Fill Value:**
> "Mrs. Johnson cancels her 2pm appointment? GroomRoute immediately identifies the gap, finds customers on your waitlist nearby, and sends them: 'Last-minute opening today!'"

**Review Math:**
> "20 appointments/week × 15% review rate = 12 new reviews/month. In 6 months: 8 reviews → 80+ reviews"

**Calm CTA:**
> "Ready to run calmer, more profitable days? You already work hard enough. Your schedule shouldn't fight you."

**Marketing Services (Not Pushy):**
